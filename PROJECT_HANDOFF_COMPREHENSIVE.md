# Twickenham Events Project Handoff

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating a comprehensive event-handling system for the Richmond Council, utilizing web scraping techniques and AI-powered event processing. The goal is to curate events from various sources and provide timely information to the community.

## Detailed File Structure
- **/scraper**: Contains scripts for web scraping.
- **/ai_processing**: AI models and processing scripts.
- **/config**: Configuration files, including `config.json`.
- **/cache**: Redis caching implementation.
- **/testing**: Testing scripts and procedures.
- **/deployment**: Deployment scripts and documentation.

## Web Scraping Implementation
Utilize Beautiful Soup for scraping event data from the Richmond Council's website. The scraper will extract necessary details such as event name, date, time, and location.

## Google Gemini AI Integration
Integrate Google Gemini AI for processing the scraped events. This AI will help in shortening event descriptions and adding country flags to enhance user experience.

## MQTT Publishing
The system will publish events to the MQTT topic: `twickenham/events`, allowing for real-time updates to subscribed clients.

## Home Assistant Integration
Events will be integrated into Home Assistant for smart home notifications and automation related to local events.

## Configuration Management
Utilize `config.json` for managing configuration settings across different environments. This includes API keys, database connections, and other critical settings.

## Redis Caching
Implement Redis caching to improve the performance of event data retrieval, ensuring quick access to frequently requested information.

## Testing Procedures
Establish comprehensive testing procedures to ensure the reliability of the web scraper, AI processing, and overall system functionality. This includes unit tests and integration tests.

## Deployment Steps
Outline the steps for deploying the application to production, including environment setup, dependencies installation, and deployment commands.

## Maintenance Guidelines
Provide guidelines for maintaining the system, including regular updates, monitoring for errors, and procedures for adding new event sources.
