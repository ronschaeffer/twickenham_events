# MQTT Publisher - Ruff Migration Complete

## ✅ Successfully Resolved Pre-commit Conflicts

The MQTT Publisher project has been successfully migrated from the mixed toolchain (black, isort, flake8, autopep8) to a unified **Ruff-based** approach.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Pre-commit Configuration** (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
- ❌ **Removed:** `black`, `isort`, `flake8` hooks
- ✅ **Added:** `ruff` and `ruff-format` hooks
- ✅ **Kept:** `mypy`, `codespell`, and basic pre-commit-hooks

#### 2. **Dependencies** (`pyproject.toml`)
- ❌ **Removed:** `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, `autopep8` 
- ✅ **Added:** `ruff ^0.12.7`
- ✅ **Updated:** Development dependencies to use Ruff exclusively

#### 3. **Code Quality Fixes**
- ✅ **Fixed:** Exception chaining (`raise ... from err`)
- ✅ **Fixed:** Modern isinstance syntax (`dict | list` instead of `(dict, list)`)
- ✅ **Fixed:** Proper exception handling in tests

#### 4. **Validation**
- ✅ **Pre-commit hooks:** All passing
- ✅ **Git status:** Clean working directory
- ✅ **Ruff integration:** Working correctly with VS Code
- ✅ **Testing:** pytest still functional

### Benefits Achieved:

1. **🚀 Performance:** Ruff is significantly faster than the old toolchain
2. **🔧 Consistency:** Single tool handles formatting, linting, and import sorting
3. **⚙️ Simplified:** Fewer dependencies and configuration files to maintain
4. **🎯 Modern:** Using latest Python toolchain standards
5. **🔄 Compatible:** Seamless integration with existing workflow

### Available Commands:

```bash
# Format both projects
dev-format

# Check project status  
dev-status

# Update pre-commit environments
update-precommit

# Run all tests
dev-test
```

## Next Steps:

The development environment is now fully optimized and consistent across all projects. Both **Twickenham Events** and **MQTT Publisher** use the same Ruff-based toolchain for maximum efficiency and consistency.
